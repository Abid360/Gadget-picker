      <h4>How react works?</h4>
      <p>
        ReactJS separates the user interface (UI) into independent, reusable
        code parts known as components. Because they take arbitrary inputs
        called properties or props, React components operate similarly to
        JavaScript functions. You can have as many components as you need
        without your code being cluttered.
      </p>
      <h4>How useState works?</h4>
      <p>
        useState is a Hook (function) that allows state variables to be used in
        functional components. If you wish to set the variable's initial value,
        send it as an input to the useState function. Simply said, it helps us
        to keep track of state in a function component.
